1. Bootstrapping
  - Add a bootstrapper for packer
  - test bringing up the container with an empty .local folder.

2. LSP integration
  - set up nvim-lsp
  - get this working for:
    - rust
    - python
    - lua
    - go
    - haskell
    - zig
    - bash
  
  - "Definition buffer"
    - instead of the popups for definitions on code-completions, have a buffer that populates with
      the relevant LSP data.
    - possibly extend this to code actions
    - get this to play nice with nvim-tree 
    - portrait mode (on the bottom)

3. Fix Feline configuration for status & winbar
  - Defaults I don't hate for these, based on lvim setup.

  - Colorscheme hooks
    - work out how these colorschemes best borrow from the base16 methodology, so that the scheme
      is coherent in the event of a colour change.
